# Book Topic Classification

Trying to build a topic classification model for books (mostly in spanish), for a dataset scrapped from Buscalibre.cl.

I'm covering Data Scrap, Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning Models.

1. Run data_scrapping.py to gather the train and test sets.
2. Run data_analysis_part1.ipynb and data_analysis_part2.ipynb to get an Statistical Analysis of the data.
3. Run numeric_ml_model.ipynb to get a review of some basic ML models for the numerical data.
